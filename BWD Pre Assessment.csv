You will have to use teamwork your entire life, so it is very important to practice good teamwork skills.","Controlling everything is not what leadership is about. Leadership is about setting examples for others, making responsible decisions, helping others, and being somewhat independent. Being ""bossy"" is NOT how to be a good leader. If my teacher (a.k.a. leader of the classroom) went around being bossy all of the time and screaming at everyone, no one would want to listen to her. So, being a good leader takes quite a bit of responsibility.","In my personal opinion, when it comes to managing money I am decent. I have had several experiences also. I know when managing money ALL decisions are important. If money is not managed properly then your business may not make any profit from your product or service. Or if you're responsible for managing bills in your household, all of the income that you get or the others in the household get has to be managed and spent on things that are needed and the rest goes towards bills. Managing your money is very important. Especially in a business, because if not your business will not run correctly and probably won't run very long.Proper management of your money will help your business produce, sell, and help you get a profit from your product or service.",90

I know that when managing money you must know how to count it and how to add or subtract the money. You must know the balance of the money you have after the sale of the products are over.

If you have teamwork the work you were assinged can get done faster.  Like, if you had to research ten different topics about a person and you were the only person in your group it would take a long time.  Most of the time, you have a limited time period to finish a assigment.  But if you have ten people doing the assigment it would take a shorter time because each person can research one topic at the same time.  Also, the quality if the work will be higher and better.  Sometimes when there is one person doing the work in a limited time he/she rushes.  And when you rush the quality of the work will not be as high and good as when you do it with a group.  And when you are in a company and the quality isn't good not a lot of people will buy the item or whatever the assigment or task was.       ","I learned that sometimes you have to take the lead, and make sure the work is getting done.  Also, you have to be nice to the other people in your group and take all of the people's ideas and put them in one final choice.  For example, if you are the leader and you  are fooling around you are not going to get the work done.  So you should make sure you and the rest of the people in your company or group are staying on task.  And if you're not nice to your workers they might go to another company.  And soon, all the workers will leave your company and you will have to either get new workers, which will take a long time or shut down.  In conclusion, I learned that to be a leader you have to be nice, and you have to concentrate on the work.   ","What I know about maniging money is that you have to make sure your getting a good amount of money.  And you have to  distribute the money to the rest of the company fairly.  If you don't get enough money you can't pay the rent, the lighting ext...  If you can't fix the lighting, and pay the rent you will have to shut down, and you won't have a company anymore.  Also, if you don't distribute the money fairly the people who work in the company will starts to find another company to work in because your not giving them enough money.  You have to balance the money with the work they do.  For example, if they do a lot of work you give them a little more money then you usually give them.  If they just clean the floors your probably don't give them as much money.       ",45
